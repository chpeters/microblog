I added a user and follows resource to the app. Users can create a new account from the home page. Users can login, and if they do, they see all their and their following tweets on the homepage. They can also logout. On the follows page, users can see a list of users they follow, and those that they don't follow yet. They can follow and unfollow users on that page.

I also added some basic features to the posts resource. Users can now only see and edit their own posts. The messages index pages still now only show the logged in user's posts. Logged out users aren't presented the messages or follows pages.
